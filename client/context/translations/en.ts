  "about.history1": "Levier is the project of Javier Bernal (Shefvier): chef, model, and content creator.",
  "about.history2": "The story begins in Barcelona, when shefvier ate hummus almost daily and realized that most supermarket options were too acidic and loaded with additives. He started making his own hummus at home, looking for something cleaner, more balanced, and delicious.",
  "about.history3": "Over time, another key point emerged: he could no longer consume gluten, and that not only changed his diet but also the way he creates. He incorporated that reality into his daily life and all his products.",
  "about.history4": "Since 2020, also inspired by the pandemic, he decided to lead a much healthier and more conscious lifestyle, and wanted that way of living to be enjoyed in something as simple as what you eat.",
  "about.history5": "At the same time, he has always played with mixing haute cuisine with fashion and lifestyle.",
  "about.history6": "Levier is exactly that: turning that mix into a brand.",
